You can perform a printing test by performing the following. Test Printing on Slip PaperMake sure all the covers are closed.While pressing the Release button, turn on the printer.After the Slip LED flashes, insert the slip paper. If there is no print on the paper, it is a hardware issue. Please troubleshoot the ink ribbon or the printer itself. If the test print works without issue, please determine if the printer attempts to print when endorsing a check. The printer is quite noisy when it tries to print, so it should be noticeable if it is trying. Please let us know if no attempt is being made, and contact helpdesk so we can gather the transaction details and retail error/CHM logs."

Verify the service tag of the server to be replaced and start the activity.2.Remove/unplug the power cables and network cables from the old rack server. Remove hard disks from the hard disk bay on the front side of the server. MARK THEM SO YOU KNOW WHICH SLOT THEY CAME FROM.3.Open the old server and look for BOSS-S1 controller card along with 2 SSD disks (M2 form factor), remove it from the server. This needs to be moved to the new server.4.Remove all hard disks in the front side (3.5 T and 16 T) from OLD server and install them in the NEW server in the same slots. (need to swap all disks from old server to new server in the same slots).5.Install the BOSS-S1 controller card along with 2 SSD disks (M2 form factor) in the slot in the new server.6.Close the top panel of the server AND insert the server in the server slot and plug in power cables and network cables (in the same slots as before) and DONT POWER ON THE SERVER.7.Have tech tell you if it starts to turn on (lights come on). If it does, turn off the server.8.DO NOT POWER ON THE SERVER UNTIL YOU VERIFY THE BOOT ORDER. (IF YOU TURN ON THE SERVER WITHOUT RESETTING THE BOOT ORDER, IT WILL WIPE THE EXISTING DRIVES).9.After the server replacement, ask the tech to write a note on the paper and place it in the old(bad) server. That paper should state Replace system board. That way, when vendor analyses the server, the techs at Washburn know to replace the system board before returning it back into the parts pool.10.Remind vendor L2 to update the ServiceNow CI with the new asset tag from the new server. (If Vendor does not have access to update CI, inform Server team to get it updated.)11.Handover to Server Team for next steps---Hi Team,Please t1886bmh1103 - 15QX144 | Please perform Full Server Replacement | PowerEdge R650xsit requires minimum of 2 hours after stores close hours.For this server we have FAN 1A issue and as per Dell suggestion we done cable reseat at FAN and motherboard side but no luck , doing server replacement.Please contact #stores_hosting_oncall before proceeding.Location: Control RoomLift Required: NoShipment Id: 1Z1F43650157125571Return Id: 1Z1F43650357632902Part: 210-AZKL-STShipped Serial Number: UNKNOWNRevisit Code: UNKNOWN2025-05-14T13:42:08ZPowerEdge R650xsServer2.592E8Equipment Description: SERVER-DELL R650XS1210-AZKL-ST1UNKNOWN1Z1F436501571255711Z1F43650357632902"

See photos.FIRST!!!Tech will need to connect camera to known good home run or directly to the switch with a patch cable and contact Level 2 support to verify if camera can be configured. If issues persist, new camera is required.If camera can be configured then issues are present with the home run or patch cabling.1. Tone and test the cable run, including patch cables, to confirm exactly where the cabling connects in the control room (DO NOT ASSUME BASED ON LABELS OR LAST KNOWN PORTS)2. Reterminate all connections and replace patch cables as required.3. Contact Level 2 to confirm the current switch and port is on the correct VLAN and device is online and configured.4. If home run requires replacement, provide photos showing the cable test results, cabling damage, etc.Note previous notes indicate the home run connects to a biscuit outside of the patch panel, but after multiple attempts to try different ports it is unclear which port it is currently connected to.----------No Parts Required - Cable Connectivity Check AND Repair - Cable test pictures, Switch # Unit # Port # information, AND patch panel port detail required----------PREVIOUS VISIT: SC01280144 - Cabling tests good, suspect camera, but wasn't tested on known good run or connected to switch as requested.Location: Control RoomLift Required: NoShipment Id: 1Z1F43650155447174Return Id: 1Z1F43650356947342Part: P12-MKII-P1265Shipped Serial Number: UNKNOWNRevisit Code: UNKNOWN2025-06-03T14:35:39ZP12 MkIITVS - Assets6.048E8Equipment Description: TVS-UNKNOWN1P12-MKII-P12651UNKNOWN1Z1F436501554471741Z1F43650356947342"
